Data Clean Assignment Week 4

This repo has the following files:

1. CodeBook.txt: An explanation of the database and all the variables in the tidydataset

2. run_analysis.R: R file with the code required to complete the asssigment. The R file does the following: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3. TidyDataSetAxial.txt: Tidy dataset constructed using the code run_analysis.R that contains all Axial variables

4. TidyDataSetNonAxial.txt: Tidy dataset constructed using the code run_analysis.R that contains all Non-Axial variables

5. ActivityLables.txt: Activity label dataset
